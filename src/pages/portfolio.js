    <h1>Front-end Work</h1>
    <p>I specialize in front-end development, and I believe I can make any design a reality. I'm not a designer by trade, but I like to dabble and design via CSS.</p>
    <p>For many of these projects, I was the sole developer. For a few, I worked with my good friend and colleague Kaizhi Wei.</p>
    <p>Generally, the main focus was PSD2HTML. Some were flat sites, others were driven by WordPress. I used HAML and SASS were used for rapid prototyping, and image spritesheets whenever applicable.</p>
    <p>Many sites had needed custom widgets. I've coded dozens of custom slideshows in my time, interactive maps, and several full-spread responsive image-based landing pages.</p>
    <p>I'm experienced with integration of external services â€“ yelp, Facebook, iHomeFinder, and other 3rd party weather services.</p>
    <p>These days, I've fleshed out more in terms of back-end development. I'd still consider myself primarily a front-end developer, as I'd say that's where the majority of my talents lie. There's just something so satisfying about seeing things come to life in front of your eyes!</p>
